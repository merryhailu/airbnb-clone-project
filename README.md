### Why User-Friendly Design Matters in a Booking System

A user-friendly design reduces friction and confusion during the browsing and booking process. In a high-stakes system like booking accommodations, clarity, speed, and trust are critical. Users should feel confident navigating the platform, understanding prices, and completing a booking with minimal steps and no uncertainty. A good design boosts user retention, reduces bounce rates, and increases successful conversions.
